          <h3>Techmatters</h3>
          <br />
          Techmatters is a project maintained by Frits Oosterhoff.
          This project is <bold>NOT</bold> supposed to be used as an actual <b>social network</b>, this project is <b>only</b> a placeholder.
          The data it contains is only used as place holder data.
          <br />
          <br />Most of the functionalities were ported from a previous project, a social network system built on Laravel.
          This project is located here: <a target="_blank" href="https://social.fritsoosterhoff.nl" > social.fritsoosterhoff.nl </a>
          <br />

          <h3>About this project </h3>
          <br />
          My goal for this project is to get a better understanding of frameworks like Laravel, Vue, GIT, Sass and SEO.
          As i kept building upon the project i decided to build another more complete web app, which would become Techmatters.
