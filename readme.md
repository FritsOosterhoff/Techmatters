A laravel powered Social network

### Techmatters
Techmatters is a project maintained by Frits Oosterhoff. This project is **NOT** supposed to be used as an **actual social network**, this project is **only** a placeholder. The data it contains is only used as place holder data.  

Most of the functionalities were ported from a previous project, a social network system built on Laravel. This project is located here: [social.fritsoosterhoff.nl](https://social.fritsoosterhoff.nl/)  


### About this project


My goal for this project is to get a better understanding of frameworks like Laravel, Vue, GIT, Sass and SEO. As i kept building upon the project i decided to build another more complete web app, which would become Techmatters.

### Prerequisites

A working webserver with at least:

* PHP >= 7.0.0
* mySQL
* OpenSSL PHP Extension
* PDO PHP Extension
* Mbstring PHP Extension
* Tokenizer PHP Extension
* XML PHP Extension

### color theme


### Installing

Change the `.env` file in the root folder or copy the default env.default file, and configure your database correctly.

```
git clone url
```

And to install the correct requirements

```
composer install
```

As laravel requires some folders to have different folder permissions change the following permissions;
```
ch+
```

And you should be fine
